      When i was 10yrs, drawing became my inspiration to creat and expand my mind through art by experiencing new styles and strategies so continue to practice to get better then one day make my own animation. My mind is always expanding and exploring myself with passion continually to grow to achieve and strive for my goal to become an animator some of the stuff i made were basic weapons out paper from anime or cartoon like origami.
